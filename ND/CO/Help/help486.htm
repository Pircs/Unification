	      <TD> <p>Reincarnation:</p>
	        <p>Players who've Reborn twice can be Reincarnated.</p>
	        <p>As long as you meet the requirements for the Reincarnation, you can be Reincarnated as many times as you like. You must be at least Level 110 after your 2nd Rebirth and have an Oblivion Dew.</p>
	        <p>Reincarnation will help you obtain new class combinations, or those who choose the same class for all 3 lives and become a Pure class! Then you are entitled to learn the Pure Skills for your class from your class trainer, in the Job Center.</p>
	        <p>The Reincarnation will not grant you any bonus BP and all your current class skills will return to level 1, but will return to their previous levels when you reach level 110. Please note that only the classes for the current three lives will be counted. All skills you learned before these lives will be forgotten. </p>
	        <p>For example, if you are a Ninja&gt;Trojan&gt;Water Taoist, and during your Reincarnation you choose to become a Warrior, your new class combination will be Trojan&gt;Water Taoist&gt;Warrior, and the reborn skills will be assigned to you accordingly. You can preview what skills you’ll receive afterwards on the Reincarnation panel, which can be accessed through the Seer.</p>	        <p>&nbsp;</p>
