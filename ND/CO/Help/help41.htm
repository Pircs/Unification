	        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">1. At least one primary item and two secondary items are needed to compose a new item. The type of primary item and secondary items should be consistent, e.g. weapons can only be composed with weapons while armors can only be composed with armors. Weapons include short and long weapons, backswords and bows. Equipment has its category, such as hat, earring, boots, armors, rings and so on.</font></p>
	        <p align="left" class="style2"><font face="Times New Roman">2. The bonus level of secondary items should not be lower than primary item but the quality of the primary item should be higher than the secondary items.</font></p>
	        <p align="left" class="style2"><font face="Times New Roman">3. If you want to compose an item which has bonus level +6 or more, two gems are needed for a weapon, only one gem is required for an item other than a weapon (Gems of any rate).</font></p>
	        <p align="left" class="style2"><font face="Times New Roman">4. After successful composition, the bonus level of new item will be added by one. The equipment with +9 can't continue being composed. Equipment without bonus level only acts as primary item, it can't be the secondary item.</font></p>
	        <p align="left" class="style2"><font face="Times New Roman">5. You can always compose new items successfully.</font></p>
