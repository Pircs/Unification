	        <p>1.Time: Everyday from 11:00-14:00, and 19:00-23:00. </p>
	        <p>2. Participants are grouped based on their clans, and so you share the Arena Points in your clan. Daily Honor Points and Monthly Honor Points are awarded according to your clan's ranks.</p>
	        <p>3. How many times a player's team has signed up for the Clan Qualifier will be counted, so a player will receive a prize when his team has signed up for  the Clan Qualifier 20 times.</p>
	        <p> How many times a player has winned the qualifier equals only to how many times his clan has winned.</p>
	        <p>4. Players need to team up to participate in the clan qualifier, and only the Team Leader, who should also be a member of a clan, can sign up for the clan qualifier.</p>
	        <p>After the system has found your team an opponent, you have one minute to choose to Accept or Give Up. All team members of the team who are in the same clan as the leader will receive a dialogue window, asking them if they want to participate in the qualifier. They'll not be sent in until all members have made their decision. As long as one member chooses to sign up, these players will be sent in when 60 seconds is up. </p>
	        <p>If all players choose to Give Up, the clan will forfeit the match. </p>
	        <p>After a clan wins the Clan Qualifier 9 times, all participants can claim a prize.</p>
	        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	        <p>5. Teams will be pit against one another automatically by the system, but teams with players from the same clan cannot be opponents. <br>
            </p>
	        <p>6. Each player can only enlist in one type of Qualifier at a time. That means if you sign up for the Clan Qualifier, you can't join the other Qualifiers. <BR>
