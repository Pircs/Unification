            <p>The Elite PK Tournament will be held once a week. The participants will be divided into 4 groups, each according to their character level: Lv 130+, Lv 120 - Lv 129, Lv 100 - 119 and Lv Under 100. The Lv 130+ Elite PK Tournament will start first. The 3 remaining groups will each start at 2 minute intervals. Players can speak to the Elite PK Envoy to sign up for the Elite PK Tournament, 5 minutes before the Tournament starts. No entry is allowed after the Elite PK Tournament starts. You will receive 1 Exp Ball and 1000 Honor Points for each match you fight. You will be knocked out of the competition if you lose a match.<br> 
              <br>
			You need to wait in the waiting room for the tournament to begin grouping. You will lose your chance to participate the Elite PK Tournament if you quit while you are in the waiting room. Players will fight in a 1 on 1 match in the Knock-Out phase, with the winner movin on to the next round. Each match in the Knock-Out phase lasts for 3 minutes. If no player falls by the end of the match, each players' score in the Elite PK Tournament will be used to decide the winner of the match. If the both players score the same, the player with the higher Battle Power and level will be the winner of the match. After all matches of the previous round are over, the next round of the Elite PK Tournament will start.<br>
              <br>
			The Elite PK Tournament enters the final phase when the last eight players emerge. Each match in the final phase lasts for 5 minutes. The Elite PK Tournament is over after the Champion is named. The final eight players can go to claim their rewards in the next week, when the next Elite PK Tournament starts. If a player fails to claim the reward at the appropriate time, the reward will become forfeit and they will receive no prize.<br>
