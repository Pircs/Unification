                  3. You can also activate the auto-recruit function, so that new members will be immediately accepted into the guild after they apply, if they meet your requirements. If this function is not activated, you will need to accept each member manually.<br>
                  4. 500,000 silver will be charged to release a Recruitment Advertisement. The Advertisement will last for 7 days. If you change your advertisement before the advertisement is expired, the advertisement expiry time will be reset and you will be charged again. New Ad-rate = Original Ad-rate / 7 x Remaining Ad time. Your advertisement will be moved to the front if you can offer a higher Ad-rate than the other players. If 2 Ad-rate offers are the same, the advertisement released earlier will be placed at the front.<br>
