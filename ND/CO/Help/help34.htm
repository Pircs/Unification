              <br>
  The Trojans stand for strength. They are good at two-handed weapons and combat skills. They declare they fear no hurt, but some said they did. They always attack and kill enemies desperately that enemies never have a chance to hurt them. <br>
              <br>
  Trojans can be promoted as Veteran Trojan, Tiger Trojan, Dragon Trojan and Trojan King.</p>

              <font color="#00FF00">Archer: </font><br>
              <br>
  There are eyes staring at you in the darkness. Their mission is to kill you if you deserve it. The archer speed never let you down, their skill with the bow and arrow is unsurpassable. They hit a target as accurate as an eagle, as swift as a rabbit. The most important is they would kill you before you have chance to get close to them. <br>
              <br>
  Archer can be promoted as Eagle Archer, Tiger Archer, Dragon Archer and Archer King.</p>
	        <p><br>
              <font color="#00FF00">Warrior:</font></p>
	        <p>Warriors are adept in the use of all kinds of weapons, armors and combat skills. They are loyal and fearless. They fight for a belief, for their country and for the right... So they hide themselves in heavy armors, for the endless combat.</p>
	        <p>Warrior can be promoted to Brass Warrior, Silver Warrior, Gold Warrior and Warrior King.<br>
