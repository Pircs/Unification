       <TD>This is a contest based on the feeling that nothing is more honorable than a fair fight. The competition has set the maximum for equipment and the character's Battle Power. The only thing that really matters is the skill of the fighters and their teamwork!<br>
           <br> Rules and Restrictions: <br>
       <br>1. Maximum value of equipment (including mounts): Super One Socket +4. If you have better items equipped, they will default to the maximum value.<br>
       <br>2. Maximum level of equipment: Level 120. If you have items of a higher level equipped, they will default to Level 120.<br>
       <br>3. Maximum Nobility: Earl. If your rank is higher than that, it will default to Earl.<br>
       <br>4. The Battle Power you share from your Clan, Mentor, and Guild do not count.<br>
       <br>5. Highest level of Sub-class (except Apothecary): Level 5. If your Sub-class level is higher than that, it will default to Level 5. There are no restrictions to the Apothecary.<br>
       <br>6. There are no limits on Refinery effects, however Dragon Souls are nullified.<br>
       <br>7. Only 60% of the total Inner-strength Attributes of the Jiang Hu will be counted.<br>
       <br>  It's show time! Come join in and see if your team has what it takes! </TD>
