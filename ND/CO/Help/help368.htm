            <p>The requirements to create a Clan are simple! Your character needs to be above level 50 and have 500,000 silver on hand for the Clan registration fee. The maximum number of members in a Clan is 12. This consists of 6 core members and their spouses.<br>
<br>

After you create a Clan, you will be able to join in the Clan War! If you can manage to win the Clan War, you will obtain an EXP reward and gift packs for occupying the map. The longer you occupy a map, the better the prize you will get! The rewards are different for each Clan War map, and they are ranked in the following order: Twin City, Desert City, Bird Island, Ape City and Phoenix Castle. <br><br>


Clans have 5 levels and the revenue provided from the Clan War for is different for each level. You can upgrade the Clan and the BP Bonus Level. With the BP Bonus Level, the Clan members can share a certain percentage of the Battle Power margin between themselves and the highest Battle Power team member in the same map. The amount of Battle Power shared will be given according to the BP Bonus Level of the Clan.
