	        <p>Guild Reward</p>
	        <p>You can see the total reward set by the Guild Leader for the next match of the Guild Contest/Guild PK Tournament at the top of the screen. At the end of that match, the system will allocate the money to its members, based on your Exploits. The higher your Exploits are, the more money you'll get!</p>
	        <p>The Exploits ranking and the rewards each member has received is shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>
	        <p>Only the guild leader can set the reward amounts. If no rewards have been set, the leader can click the reward button and set a CP reward, a silver reward, or both. The reward amount should be no less than 100.</p>
	        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	        <p>The guild leader can also add rewards again, if the reward has been set. There is no limit to the amount they can add. </p>
