	        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">They call themselves as warrior. They are tired of the pointless combat. They seek to serve for their national interest or select some other ways to offer their protection. They need a belief, a righteous reason for bloodshed. They do not have belief in themselves as before. They equip themselves with heavy armor from being hurt. </font></p>

                <font color="#00FF00"> (2) Trojan: </font></font></p>
	        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Their hot temper makes them away from others. They declare they fear no hurt. But some other say they do. Their fear for being hurt makes them attack and kill enemy more desperately. </font></p>
	        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Trojan can be promoted as Brass Trojan, Tiger Trojan, Dragon Trojan and Trojan King. </font></p>

  (3) Archer: </font></p>
	        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">There is eye staring at you in the darkness. Their mission is to kill you if you deserve it. The archer speed never let you down, their skill with the bow and arrow is unsurpassable. They hit a target as accurate as an eagle, as swift as a rabbit. The most important is they would kill you before you have chance to get close to them. </font></p>
	        <p><font color="#CCCCCC">Archer can be promoted as Eagle Archer, Tiger Archer, Dragon Archer and Archer King. <br>
