Rule 

Cards

A standard deck of 52 playing cards, with no Jokers.

Number of Players 

2-9 Players. 2 players can start a game, up to a maximum of 9 players.

Dealer 

At the beginning of each hand, the system will deal one card to each player. Players will 
compare their cards. The one with the highest card is the dealer. The Dealer position will 
rotate clockwise, after each hand. If a player quits the room, the system will do this to 
determine the Dealer. 

Small Blind 

After the Dealer is determined, the player to the left of the dealer is required to place a Small 
Blind. The small blind puts up half the minimum bet.



Big Blind

The player two to the left of the Dealer is required to place a Big Blind before the cards are 
dealt. The Big Blind puts up a bet equal to the minimum table limit.

Dealt Cards

Each player is dealt two cards, face down.

 

 

Pocket Cards 

The 2 cards dealt first are your pocket cards. Only you can see these cards.

 

Community Cards 

Then, 5 cards are dealt face up on the table by the Dealer. These are the Community cards. Anyone 
can use them in combination with their two pocket cards to form a poker hand.

 

Bet

Place a bet when there is no bet in the pot.

 

Call 

Follow the other players and bet the same amount as the previous player. You can`t change the 
bet, when Calling. If you don`t have enough Gold to Call the same amount as the previous player, 
your only option is to go All-in.


Fold

Folds the current hand and forfeit your bet. If no action is made within 30 seconds, system will 
automatically Fold.

Check 

Place no bet, at that time. Betting moves to the next player.

You can only choose to Check when you don`t need to match the bet of previous players. For
example, when no one places a bet, or everyone chooses to Check or Fold.

Raise

Raise is to increase the amount of the current bet. When the player before you has placed a bet or 
raised the bet, you will have the option Raise. If you don`t have enough Gold to Raise, your only 
options are to Call or go All-in.

All-in 

Bet all the chips you currently have. If you don¡¯t have enough chips to Call, you can choose to 
go All In. Once a player chooses All In, there will be a side pot created. The total in the main 
pot consists of the bets that are put in up to and including the All In bet. The total in the side 
pot consists of the bets placed after a player chose to go All-in. If the player who chooses 
All-in has the best 5-card hand, he will win the amount in the main pot, but not the side pot. In
that case, the player with the second best hand will win the remaining bets in the side pot. 

 

Showdown

5-Card Hand 

All of the players who haven`t folded reveal their hands. This begins with the player to the left
of the last player to Call. Players use a combination of their pocket cards and the community
cards to form a five card poker hand. The player who shows the best hand wins! Equal hands
results in a split pot between them.

Commission

After each hand, 1% of the winner`s total prize will be claimed by the Poker Hall, as commission.
